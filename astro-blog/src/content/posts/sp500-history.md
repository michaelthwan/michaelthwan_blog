## The Big Picture

A hundred dollars invested in the S&P 500 on January 1, 1926, with dividends reinvested, would have grown to approximately **$1.48 million** by 2024 — a compounded annual growth rate of **10.3%**. That single number masks a century of crashes, wars, pandemics, and policy experiments.

The chart below shows the full journey. On a logarithmic scale, the long-term trend is unmistakable: **an upward march punctuated by sharp but temporary setbacks.** Hover over the line to see exact values at any point.

Over these 98 years, the market experienced **21 bull markets** and **20 bear markets**. Each crash felt unprecedented at the time. Each recovery seemed improbable. And yet the line kept climbing.

Let's walk through the three major eras.

---

## Era I: Depression, War, and Recovery (1926–1958)

    </div>
</div>

### The Roaring Twenties (+193%)

The S&P 500 more than doubled between 1926 and its September 1929 peak. Fueled by easy credit, rampant speculation, and a booming industrial economy, the market seemed unstoppable. Margin trading allowed investors to buy stocks with just 10% down.

### The Great Depression (-83%)

Then came the crash. From September 1929 to June 1932, the S&P 500 fell from 31.9 to 4.4 — an **83% decline** that remains the worst bear market in U.S. history. The index wouldn't recover to its 1929 peak until **1954**, a full 25 years later.

The decline wasn't a single event. It came in waves: the initial crash of October 1929, a deceptive rebound in early 1930, then a grinding two-year descent as bank failures cascaded through the economy. By 1932, unemployment reached 25% and GDP had contracted by a third.

### New Deal and False Starts

The recovery was equally turbulent. FDR's New Deal programs sparked a **+105%** rebound from the 1932 lows, but the **Roosevelt Recession of 1937-38** cut the market in half again (-50%) when the government pulled back stimulus too early — a cautionary tale that would echo through future policy debates.

### World War II (-30%, then +210%)

The outbreak of World War II initially sent markets lower, bottoming in April 1942 at 7.5. But as the U.S. war machine ramped up industrial production, the market began a sustained climb. By the end of the war in 1945, the S&P had risen 210% from its wartime low.

### The Post-War Boom (+495%)

The longest bull market of this era stretched from 1947 to 1957 — over a decade of growth driven by suburbanization, consumer spending, the baby boom, and America's emergence as the world's dominant industrial power. The Eisenhower Recession of 1957 (-15%) was a brief interruption in an extraordinary run.

## Era II: Cold War, Oil, and Reaganomics (1959–1991)

        <strong>Figure 3.</strong> S&P 500, 1959–1991. This era saw more frequent cycles — six bear markets in 32 years. The Oil Shock of 1973-74 and Black Monday of 1987 were the sharpest drops.
    </div>
</div>

### The Kennedy Slide (-22%)

The early 1960s opened with a sudden 22% decline in 1962, triggered by Kennedy's confrontation with the steel industry and general overvaluation. But the drop was short-lived, and by 1965 the market had nearly doubled from its trough.

### Go-Go Years and Nifty Fifty

The mid-1960s "Go-Go" era saw speculative enthusiasm around growth stocks and conglomerates. The "Nifty Fifty" — a group of blue-chip stocks considered safe at any price — drove the market to new highs through 1972. The S&P reached 120 in January 1973.

### Vietnam, Oil, and Stagflation (-43%)

Then the world changed. The Vietnam War's economic cost, Nixon's wage-price controls, and the **OPEC oil embargo of 1973** combined to produce the worst bear market since the Depression. The S&P fell **43%** from its January 1973 peak to October 1974.

What followed was even more painful: a "lost decade" of **stagflation** — simultaneous high inflation and stagnant growth. From 1968 to 1982, the S&P 500 went essentially nowhere in real (inflation-adjusted) terms. An investor who bought at the 1968 peak didn't see a real return for over 14 years.

### Volcker's Shock Therapy (-17%)

In 1980, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker raised interest rates to **19%** to kill inflation. The short-term pain was severe — a 17% market decline and a deep recession — but it worked. Inflation fell from 14% to under 4% by 1983, setting the stage for the great bull market of the 1980s.

### Reaganomics (+282%)

Tax cuts, deregulation, and falling interest rates fueled a spectacular five-year rally from 1982 to 1987. The S&P rose **282%**, from 102 to 338.

### Black Monday (-30%, then +71%)

On October 19, 1987, the market crashed **22.6% in a single day** — the largest single-day percentage drop in history. Program trading and portfolio insurance strategies amplified the selling. But unlike the Great Depression, the recovery was swift. Within two years, the market had set new highs. The lesson: not all crashes lead to prolonged bear markets.

## Era III: The Modern Market (1992–2024)

    </div>
</div>

### The Roaring Nineties (+355%)

Globalization, the tech revolution, and the longest economic expansion in U.S. history propelled the market from 420 in 1992 to over 1,500 by early 2000. The S&P more than tripled in eight years.

The Asian Financial Crisis of 1998 (-15%) was the shortest bear market on record — just two months. It barely registered as a pause in the bull run.

### The Dot-com Bust (-43%)

The bubble burst in March 2000. Hundreds of internet companies with no profits (and sometimes no revenue) saw their stocks collapse. The S&P fell **43%** over the next two and a half years, bottoming in October 2002 at 777. The September 11 attacks in 2001 accelerated the decline but weren't the primary cause.

### The Housing Bubble and Great Recession (-51%)

After recovering from the dot-com bust, the market was hit by an even larger crisis. The **subprime mortgage meltdown** and collapse of major financial institutions (Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, AIG) triggered a **51% decline** — the worst since the Depression. The S&P bottomed at 667 in March 2009.

The recovery was fueled by unprecedented Federal Reserve intervention — quantitative easing, near-zero interest rates, and bank bailouts. From the 2009 low, the market began a bull run that would last over a decade.

### The Longest Bull Run (+240%)

From 2011 to 2020, the market rose **240%** in one of the longest bull markets in history. Low interest rates, tech-driven productivity gains, and corporate tax cuts all contributed. By February 2020, the S&P had reached 3,386.

### COVID-19 (-20%)

The pandemic crash of March 2020 was the **fastest 30% decline ever** — it took just 22 trading days. But it was also followed by the **fastest recovery ever**. Within five months, the market had fully recovered, driven by massive fiscal stimulus, Federal Reserve intervention, and a shift toward technology that benefited the largest companies.

### Inflation Returns (-24%)

Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, combined with post-pandemic inflation and aggressive Fed rate hikes, produced a **24% decline** over 10 months. By late 2023, the market had recovered again, driven by the AI boom and resilient corporate earnings.

## Bull vs. Bear: By the Numbers

Over 98 years, the pattern is clear: **bull markets are longer, larger, and more frequent than bear markets.** The average bull run gains 150% over 3.7 years. The average bear market loses 30% over 1 year.

The asymmetry is striking. **Markets spend far more time going up than going down.** But bear markets are psychologically devastating precisely because they are concentrated and violent. A 50% decline requires a 100% gain to recover — which is why crashes feel so much worse than rallies feel good.

## Recovery Times

How long does it take to recover from a crash? The answer varies enormously:

- **COVID crash (2020):** 5 months to full recovery
- **Black Monday (1987):** 2 years
- **Dot-com bust (2000):** 6.2 years to break even
- **Housing crisis (2007):** 4.4 years
- **Great Depression (1929):** 25 years — though dividends reinvested cut this significantly

The trend is toward **faster recoveries**, likely because modern central banks intervene more aggressively than their predecessors. The Federal Reserve's toolkit has expanded dramatically since the 1930s.

## Key Takeaways

<div class="takeaways">
    <div class="takeaway">
        <span class="takeaway-num">1</span>
        <div class="takeaway-content">
            <strong>The long-term trend is relentlessly upward.</strong> Despite two world wars, a global depression, oil crises, terrorist attacks, a pandemic, and countless recessions, $100 invested in 1926 became $1.48 million. The market's compounding engine is extraordinarily resilient.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="takeaway">
        <span class="takeaway-num">2</span>
        <div class="takeaway-content">
            <strong>Every crash felt like "this time is different."</strong> The Great Depression, the Oil Shock, the Dot-com bust, the Financial Crisis, COVID — each one generated narratives about permanent economic damage. Each time, the market recovered.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="takeaway">
        <span class="takeaway-num">3</span>
        <div class="takeaway-content">
            <strong>Time in the market beats timing the market.</strong> Missing just the 10 best trading days over any 20-year period cuts returns by roughly half. Those best days often occur during or immediately after crashes — exactly when panic is highest.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="takeaway">
        <span class="takeaway-num">4</span>
        <div class="takeaway-content">
            <strong>Policy responses have gotten faster.</strong> The Great Depression lasted a decade partly because the government initially did too little. Modern central banks and fiscal authorities now intervene within days, which has compressed recovery times — from 25 years in the 1930s to 5 months in 2020.
